# Tic-Tac-Toe
<p>This Tic-Tac-Toe script was created after being exposed to different design patterns, modules and learning about SOLID principles. The user plays tic-tac-toe against another user in a pass and play fashion. The classic tic-tac-toe ruleset dictates the gameflow between X and O displaying either WIN, LOSE, TIE.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Play The Game</h3>
<a href="https://oalva-rez.github.io/tic-tac-toe/">Live version</a>

<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>This project was my first ever attempt at a revealing module pattern by creating functions that returned values and/or methods. My biggest takeaway from this project was actually learning to manipulate a grid by transposing it in order to define the tic-tac-toe ruleset in a more effecient way. However, in hindsight I would not have hardcoded the X and O values but rather used click event targets on the elements and compared them to a pre-detertmined array.</p>
